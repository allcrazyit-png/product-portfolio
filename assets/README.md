# Asset Storage

This directory (`public/assets`) is the **ONLY** correct place to store images and PDF files for the product portfolio.

## Usage
- Put your `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.pdf` files here.
- The system will automatically serve files from this location.
- **Do not** put files in `dist/assets` (that folder is auto-generated and will be deleted).

## File Naming
Ensure file names match exactly what is in your CSV:
- Example: If CSV says `G92D1-VU010_main.jpg`, this folder must contain `G92D1-VU010_main.jpg`.
